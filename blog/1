Let's start from the very beginning. Create the directory for the app and add initialize the git repository.

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin master

We're going to use good old NPM so let's create a package.json file.

There's a number of ways to go from here, but we're going to start by setting up our models in Mongoose. Create a folder called 'models' and a file in that folder called User.js.
